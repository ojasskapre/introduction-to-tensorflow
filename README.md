## Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning
This repository contains all the exercises and practice notebooks I completed as part of the [Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow) course offered by Coursera.

This course provides an introduction to TensorFlow, one of the primary tools used for machine learning and deep learning. The content covers the basics of building models with TensorFlow as well as fundamental concepts of AI, ML, and Deep Learning.
